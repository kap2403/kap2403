Passionate about using cutting-edge technology to make the roads safer.

As a masters student in the field of vehicle safety, I am eager to apply my knowledge to improve vehicle safety through the use of deep learning. I have a strong foundation in machine learning and computer vision, and I am confident in my ability to develop innovative solutions for the automotive industry.

During my time in academia, I had the opportunity to work on a project focused on detecting road hazards in real-time using deep learning techniques. This experience sparked my interest in the intersection of AI and vehicle safety, and I am now seeking opportunities to further my skills in this area.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow, and I believe that working on real-world problems in the field of vehicle safety and deep learning will provide me with the experience I need to succeed. If you are looking for a motivated individual to join your team, I would love to hear from you!"
